Flow
====
A flow is a bunch of steps and the connection between the steps. So a flow is a directed graph.
The edges are the connections between the steps. The vertex is the step.
A flow has inbound and outbound steps and processing steps.
A flow must fulfill the following requirements:

- It must have a name.
- It must have a description.
- It must have at least one inbound step.
- All the steps must have at least one connection.
- All steps must be reachable from the inbound steps.

A Flow may also have endpoints which could be connected to the steps. So it is
possible to bundle steps in a flow. From the outside the flows acts as a single step.

```shell
npm install kronos-flow
```
