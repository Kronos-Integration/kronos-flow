# kronos-flow

A flow is a bunch of steps and the connection between the steps. So a flow is a directed graph.
The edges are the connections between the steps. The vertex is the step.
A flow has inbound and outbound steps and processing steps.
A flow must fulfill the following requirements:

-   It must have a name.
-   It must have a description.
-   It must have at least one inbound step.
-   All the steps must have at least one connection.
-   All steps must be reachable from the inbound steps.

A Flow may also have endpoints which could be connected to the steps. So it is
possible to bundle steps in a flow. From the outside the flows acts as a single step.

## Flow

**Extends Step**

This is the flow implementation.
It holds all the steps.
Declares the following properties:
\-steps
\-autostart

**Parameters**

-   `config` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** the definition used to create the flow
-   `owner` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** owner of the flow

### endpointFor

Find endpoint for given expression

**Parameters**

-   `expression` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 
-   `wait` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** for endpoint to become present (deliver a promise)
-   `problems` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 

Returns **Endpoint** found endpoint

### connectEndpoints

set the target endpoints

**Parameters**

-   `stepDefinition`  

### connectRootEndpoints

A flow has only endpoint proxies. These will be replaced by the original endpoints
of the sub steps
get the original endpoints for the Flow.

### name

Returns **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 'kronos-flow'

## FlowProviderMixin

mixin to create a _Flow_ owner.
Also incorporates _Step_ and _Interceptor_ ownership

**Parameters**

-   `superclass` **class** 

Returns **class** with flow ownership support

## willBeUnregistered

Deletes a flow from the stored flow definitions. If the flow
is currently running, it will be stopped first. After it
is stopped, it will be deleted.

**Parameters**

-   `flow`  

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)** returns a promise that is fullfilled when the flow is removed
        or one that rejects if there is no flow for the given flowName
